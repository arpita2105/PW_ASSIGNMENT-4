Improving the accessibility of HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) involves making your web content more user-friendly and inclusive. 

### Here are three essential ways to enhance HTML accessibility:

1. **Use Semantic HTML Elements:**
    - Semantic HTML elements like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`, and `<article>` provide a clear structure to your web page. They help assistive technologies and search engines understand the content and its organization.
    - Properly use headings `(<h1> to <h6>`) to create a hierarchical structure. Ensure that headings accurately describe the content they precede, and don't skip levels.

2. **Add Alternative Text to Images:**
    - Include descriptive alternative text (alt text) for all images using the alt attribute in the <img> element. 
    - Alt text should convey the content and purpose of the image to users who cannot see it.
    - For decorative images, use empty alt text (alt="") to indicate that the image has no informative value.

3. **Keyboard Accessibility :** 
    - Ensure that all interactive elements on your web page, such as buttons and form fields, can be navigated and activated using a keyboard alone. 
    - Avoid relying solely on mouse-based interactions. 
    - Implement focus styles to indicate which element is currently selected, and make sure the tab order follows a logical sequence.

By following these practices and considering the needs of users with disabilities, you can significantly improve the accessibility of your HTML content, making it more inclusive and user-friendly for all visitors.
